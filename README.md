## What is tf

tf.function is a decorator function provided by Tensorflow 2.0 that converts regular python code to a callable Tensorflow graph function, which is usually more performant and python independent.
It is used to create portable Tensorflow models. TensorFlow computations are expressed as stateful dataflow graphs.

The name TensorFlow derives from the operations that such neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays, which are referred to as tensors.
